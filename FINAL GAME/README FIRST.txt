All the java files belong to package "e" (see folder). In that folder are all the class files for the game. 
It is not possible to compile the java files without editing them between compiling. 
Therefore we provided the compiled class files, so that you can run the game without compiling it first.

use the command:"java e/test" to run the game.

If you want to compile manually you have to use:"javac -d . FILEYOUWANTTOCOMPILE.java".

The code for the bot is placed in a different folder.
